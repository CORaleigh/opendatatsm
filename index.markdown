#NYC OpenData Technical Standards Manual

Hello! We at the City of New York want to collaborate with you on our Open Data Policies, Technical Standards, and Guidelines. On March 7, [Local Law 11 of 2012](LocalLaw11of2012.html) - [the most progressive open government legislation in the country](http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2012a/pr081-12.html) - was enacted. Achieving the goals of the law demands significant input from the community. For additional information, see our [NYC DoITT Open Government page](http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/html/open/data.shtml).

##How to provide feedback

We want your feedback as we continuously improve our service. Here are some options for providing input on our Technical Standards Manual:

- 
- We are experimenting with [HyperComments](http://hypercomments.com/). Here is an example of an existing hypercomment. To comment on a particular section of text, highlight it, and then click the 'comment' button which appears.
- If you are github user, you can fork our repository, make direct edits to the markdown files - or use an online tool like [prose.io](http://prose.io/) - and then issue a pull request.

##More Information

This site, along with the [NYC Open Data portal](http://nyc.gov/data), is managed by the [NYC Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications](http://nyc.gov/doitt) Advanced Technologies team. That's a long way of saying we're a bunch of people who are unlocking government data. Although it probably will be available, we can't guarantee that this site is available at all times.
