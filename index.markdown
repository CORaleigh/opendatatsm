#NYC OpenData Technical Standards Manual (TSM)

Hello! We at the City of New York want to collaborate with you on our Open Data Policies, Technical Standards, and Guidelines. On March 7, [Local Law 11 of 2012](LocalLaw11of2012.html) - [the most progressive open government legislation in the country](http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2012a/pr081-12.html) - was enacted. Achieving the goals of the law demands significant input from the community. For additional information, see our [NYC DoITT Open Government page](http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/html/open/data.shtml).

## Getting around

There's a lot of information in the TSM, so we broke it up into sections to make it easier to read and provide feedback on each topic:

<ul class="button-group">
	<li><a href="background.html" class="small button">Background</a></li>
	<li><a href="defintions.html" class="small button">Definitions</a></li>
   	<li><a href="citypolicies.html" class="small button">City Policies</a></li>
	<li><a href="publicpolicies.html" class="small button">Public Policies</a></li>
	<li><a href="citystandards.html" class="small button">City Standards</a></li>
	<li><a href="publicstandards.html" class="small button">Public Standards</a></li>
	<li><a href="cityguidelines.html" class="small button">City Guidelines</a></li>
</ul>

There's also a copy of [Local Law 11 of 2012](LocalLaw11of2012.html), which serves as the foundation for all of the information here.

You can use the navigation menu at the top of the page to find the same sections. Finally, if you prefer, you can [view and print the most recent official version](http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/downloads/pdf/nyc_open_data_tsm.pdf).

##How to provide feedback

We want your feedback as we continuously improve our service, but please note that we do not allow complete anonymity. To make sure your ideas are clearly understood by others, please keep them on-topic and refrain from language that others might find offensive. (Be sure to see our terms of service, below.)

Here are some options for providing input on our Technical Standards Manual:

- Use the comments area at the bottom of each page. 
- We are experimenting with [HyperComments](http://hypercomments.com/). Here is an example of an existing hypercomment. To comment on a particular section of text, highlight it, and then click the 'comment' button which appears.
- If you are use Github, you can fork our repository, make direct edits to the markdown files - or use an online tool like [prose.io](http://prose.io/) - and then issue a pull request.

##More Information

This site, along with the [NYC Open Data portal](http://nyc.gov/data), is managed by the [NYC Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications](http://nyc.gov/doitt) Advanced Technologies team. That's a long way of saying we're a bunch of people who are unlocking government data. Although it probably will be available, we can't guarantee that this site is available at all times.
