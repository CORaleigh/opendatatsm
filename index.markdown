On March 7, 2012, Mayor Bloomberg signed [Local Law 11 of 2012](LocalLaw11of2012.html), which amends the administrative code to mandate that qualifying City-managed digital data be made available to the public-at-large through a single web portal. By September 2012, the Cityâ€™s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) is to prepare and publish a technical standards manual for City agencies, setting forth policies and standards for open data. 

The legislation additionally sets forth the following timeline:

- On or before March 7, 2013, all qualifying data currently on NYC.gov must be made available via a single web portal (the NYC OpenData portal). 
- On or before September 9, 2013, DoITT, on behalf of the City, must publish a compliance plan detailing qualifying data and the timeline to make the data publicly available. Following this, compliance plans must be updated annually and published no later than July 15th of each successive year. 
- On or before December 31, 2018, the City must complete its efforts to publish all qualifying data via the NYC OpenData portal. 

This document is the Technical Standards Manual (TSM) that defines the Citywide policies, standards, and guidelines required to support the legislation.
