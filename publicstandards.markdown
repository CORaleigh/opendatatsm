7.0	Public Standards

7.1	Web Application

The NYC OpenData portal supports most modern web browsers. The web application permits the listing, viewing, exporting, embedding, filtering, visualizing, personalizing, commenting on, and rating of public data sets.

7.2	Application Programming Interface (API)

The NYC OpenData portal supports a generic API that permits access to all published data sets in a similar manner. The API is based upon the Socrata Open Data API (SODA).

7.3	Download Formats

In 2009, the U.S. Government defined an open file format as “one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information.” 
The NYC OpenData portal supports the public downloading of data sets in the following formats:

<table>
	<thead>
    	<tr>
    		<th>Type</th><th>Media</th><th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    	<tr>
        	<td>[CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)</td><td>Text</td><td>Comma-separated values</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Type	Type	Description
CSV	Text	Comma-separated values
JSON	Text	JavaScript Object Notation
PDF	Binary	Portable Document Format
RDF	Text	Resource Description Framework
RSS	Text	RDF Site Summary/Really Simple Syndication
(Note: each row is represented as a separate item, but each item’s description field contains an HTML table with the column names and row values)
XLS	Binary	Microsoft Excel
XLSX	Binary	Microsoft Excel Open XML
XML	Text	Extensible Markup Language

In addition, some data sets may also have the following formats available:

Type	Type	Description
